## Terminology

There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which we clarify here for external readers:

**CL**: Stands for "changelist," which means one self-contained change that has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review. Other organizations often call this a "change" or a "patch."

**LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me." It is what a code reviewer says when approving a CL.
